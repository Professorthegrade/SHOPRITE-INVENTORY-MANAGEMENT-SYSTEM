OVERVIEW
This inventory management system is designed for Shoprite Ghana Limited. This project includes both functional and non-functional requirements as part of the software development cycle they wish to implement.

HOME PAGE
This is the first page the user is confronted with. The page affords the user, be it Admin or Staff, channel to access either Admin login page or Staff login page. If you are an admin, you can access both the Admin page and the Staff page thus enabling the Admin chance to monitor transactions history, sales receipt and stocks. If you are a Staff, you cannot enter the Admin’s page. The staff can only access the Staff’s page but once you are axed, you can no longer access the Staff’s page.  


ADMIN LOGIN PAGE
This page consists of four features basically the username text field,the password textfield,forgot password button and login button.the username text field is where the admin types in his/her desired name used in the database section.if the admin enters an invalid username,it wouldn’t grant him/her access to the admin page.an invalid credential entered into even one part wouldn’t proceed to the admin page.the password text field is where the admin inserts his/her hashed password used in the database section into the text field.likewise,the password text field wouldn’t grant the admin access if he/she enters the wrong data into the password text field.the forgot password button enables the admin an opportunity to change or better still recover his/her password.the login button when clicked,sends the admin straight to the admin page.if the admin enters invalid data and presses on the login button,it wouldn’t grant him/her access to the admin page.



ADMIN PAGE
This is the page in which the admin operates. The page consists of four features which includes: the app space, the re-stock button, add member button and delete member button. The app space is rendered null unless the re-stock button is selected. The re-stock button displays the products, which at the moment, are out of stock. It gives the admin a hint to re-stock those finished goods or items in due time. The add member button links the admin to the add staff page. This button enables the admin the tutelage to add new employees to the inventory management system. The delete member button links the admin to the delete staff page. This button enables the admin to axe or delete employees whose services are no longer needed or welcomed. 
ADD STAFF PAGE
This page is only allowed to the administrator. The admin uses this page to add a new member to the system. The page contains six text fields. The data entered into the various text fields would be stored in the database immediately the admin clicks on the add staff button. Leaving a text field blank wouldn’t allow the admin to add a new member unless he fills the text field. After the admin clicks the add staff button, he/she cannot mismatch the credentials in the subsequent login attempts. It wouldn’t allow the admin to access the staff page.


DELETE STAFF PAGE
This is the page that the admin uses to axe or delete a member whose services is no longer needed. The page contains five text fields. The admin would enter the name and password of the member he or she wishes to fire from his/her management. The admin also enters his/her username and password before proceeding to click the delete staff button. This action cannot be undone once the delete staff button is selected. It would clear the data of the person from the database.

STAFF PAGE
This page is strictly operated by the staff. It contains three text fields, three buttons, an app space and a welcome staff display. The welcome feature displays the name of the staff who entered the page alongside welcome! The barcode text field is a code which calls the product and displays the product details in the app space once the user clicks the find button. The number text field allows the staff to increase or decrease the quantity of the product. The item text field calls the name of the item from the database and displays the product along with the details in the app space. The preview button displays the summary of the product the staff searched. The add-to-cart button adds the product to the cart.


PASSWORD RESET PAGE
This page helps both the admin and staff to reconfigure their passwords. The page contains four text fields and two buttons. The staff or admin must enter their credentials into the text fields and press the staff reconfigure button or admin reconfigure button respectively.
